## Summary

Yelp thrives on the numerous reviews that are left by users for local businesses and restaurants. It is of considerable value to analyze this data and find out whether they help in directing the performance of a restaurant or whether restaurant performance is indeed dictated by other factors.


In this project, we aim to solve business problems using various data science techniques to help the F&B industry leverage their data and gain more business and customers. We have explored the Yelp dataset which contains various details about the business like location details, operating hours, user reviews, check-ins, etc. 


In the first phase, we aim to deliver data science solutions to gain more business and customers for the restaurants. Firstly, we aim to predict how several factors like location, interiors, etc. can affect a restaurant’s success. This can be used when restaurants wish to open a new branch. Next, we aim to analyze reviews based on popular restaurant features. This will be used when a restaurant wants to know how well they’re doing on a certain service or dish. Finally, we aim to forecast the footfall for restaurants for the next few days. The restaurant can use this for its inventory and staffing management.


In the second phase, we aim to deliver data science solutions to enhance user experience while interacting with restaurants. Firstly, we plan to develop a recommendation system that suggests users restaurants to visit based on their friend’s activities and suggest food items a user should try based on food items they’ve eaten. Secondly, we aim to train a model that takes in a photo clicked by a user and predict the food dish present in it. For example, if the user is looking at a dish on a menu card and can't find the name of the dish, the user can scan the picture and have the model suggest the name of the dish.
